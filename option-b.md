You got a twig that was laying on the ground nearby, and started shaking it around to get the cat's attention.

"Pss pss pss kitty, catch!"

You threw the stick as far away from the house as you could. The cat didn't budge. It had an almost judmental look in it's eyes. What did you think it was? A dog? Nonsense.

Hoping that none of your new neighbours saw that embarrasing interaction, you give up on trying to play fetch with the animal. Instead, you decide to just awkwardly move the cat to the side so you could get inside the house.
