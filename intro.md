As you stepped of your car, you took a deep breath and surveyed the surroundings. You couldn't help but feel a twinge of nervous excitement as your new life began in this unfamiliar place. 

In front of you stood your future home: a cozy white house with a red front door, nestled on a quiet street lined with maple trees. You followed the stone path that lead you to the entrance, but to your surprise, a small figure was already there, waiting for your arrival. It was a black cat that stood right in fornt of your door, giving you no space to enter the house. His amber eyes, full of curiosity focused on you.
