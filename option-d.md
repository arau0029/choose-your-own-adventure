You decide to ignore the cat and continue walking towards the door, thinking it would move as soon as you've gotten too close to it, however, it doesn't.

 A little stuck on what to do, you stare at it and do a few hand gestures motioning it to move away but it only seems to come closer to you and starts rubbing against your legs. You take this chance to pick it up and move it aside, quickly reaching for the handle to open and close the door seconds after getting in. 
 
 You hear the cat curse at you from the other side, but stop after a few seconds, it seems to have walked away.
