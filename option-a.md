The first thing you thought about when you took a glimpse of that cat is a memory from your childhood. This little one sitting at your front door reminded you of Peppa, that stray cat that you would sneak some chicken pieces for back at your hometown. You would always go out to your porch during your study breaks to play with Peppa, as your mom didnâ€™t want any animals inside the house.

You kneel down on the ground to level yourself with the black cat, and offer your hand for it to sniff. Its amber eyes stare at you for a couple seconds. As soon as the kitty places its nose on your knuckles, it immediately goes for a caress. It starts circling around your feet, rubbing itself against your legs, and starts purring loudly: It chose you. You decided to name it Peppy. 

You remember the left-over chicken sandwich you had in a lunch box, as a quick meal while moving to your new home. You took a piece of chicken out and gave it to Peppy, then slowly lured it inside through the red front door. You set up a little corner with pillows and an old blanket as a temporary bed for the cat, until you were able to buy new furniture. 

Not only you moved into a new house and city to start your life again, but you also gave a stray cat a loving forever home.
