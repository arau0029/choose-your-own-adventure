You walk towards the door, heart beating fast as your love for cats just makes you burst in excitement once you lay your eyes on one. As soon as you come close enough, the cat decides to rub itself against your legs and give you a warm welcome, but the more you look at the cat, the more you notice that it seems malnourished. 

Feeling bad for it, you back away and walk towards your car. You decide to make your way to the nearest convience store to buy some bowls and food to feed it for as long as it decides to stay on your new proprety. 

Rushing back to the house after your errands, you notice that the cat is in the same spot as before, not moving even one inch. 

You slowly place the bowl and fill it with food and another with water, watching the cat launch itself towards the bowls the second they were put down. 

Looks like you might have another responisbility on your hands
