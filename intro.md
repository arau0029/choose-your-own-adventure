As you stepped of your car, you took a deep breath and surveyed the surroundings. You couldn't help but feel a twinge of nervous excitement as your new life began in this unfamiliar place. 

In front of you stood your future home: a cozy white house with a red front door, nestled on a quiet street lined with maple trees. You followed the stone path that lead you to the entrance, but to your surprise, a small figure was already there, waiting for your arrival. It was a black cat that stood right in fornt of your door, giving you no space to enter the house. His amber eyes, full of curiosity focused on you.

What will you do?
