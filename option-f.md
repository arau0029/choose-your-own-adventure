Everyone knows black cats are a bad omen. Sure, that might only be a superstition, but you couldn't risk it. You just started a new chapter in life, so the last thing you need is bad luck. 

You decide to push the animal away with your feet, showing it was not welcome in your porch. The cat hissed at you an ran away. 

You might regret that choice in the future.
