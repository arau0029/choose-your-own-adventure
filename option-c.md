As soon as you noticed the small figure that was sitting in front of your porch was a beautiful black cat, your instict was to go onwards and pet it. You crouch down to be eye-level with the cat then you decide to reach out your hand, allowing the cat to sniff you. Permitting the cat to know you are a friendly stranger. 

A quick second after the cat sniffed your hand, it snoozleed right up your hand allowing you to pet him. It then soflty meowed at you. You continue to pet him. 

A few minutes have gone by, you get up on your feet and start inside your house. The black cat meows at you and begins to follow you. You already made a new friend in this new town. You can't help but to feel excited to what is yet to come.
