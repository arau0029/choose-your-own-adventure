As soon as you noticed the small figure that was sitting in front of your porch was a beautiful black cat, your instict was to go onwards and pet it. You crouch down to be eye-level with the cat then you decide to reach out your hand, allowing the cat to sniff you. Permitting the cat to know you are a friendly stranger. 

A quick second after the cat sniffed your hand, it snoozleed right up your hand allowing you to pet him. It then soflty meowed at you. You continue to pet him. 

A few minutes have gone by, you get up on your feet and start inside your house. The black cat meows at you and begins to follow you. You already made a new friend in this new town. You can't help but to feel excited to what is yet to come. 

Settled in the house you go get a bowl to fill it up with water. The cat meows at you as you bring the bowl over to him. As soon as you place the bowl on the floor the black cat begins to drink it at an impressive speed. You wonder to yourslef how long had it been since the cat had a zip of water. Then you think to yourself that it is time to go on a grocery run, specially to buy your new cat, the one you still need to name some food.
